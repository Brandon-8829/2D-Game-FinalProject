##description

This is the code related to my final year project. I had to learn the fundementals of game development along with knowledge of Unity software and C# programming language to complete the project. 

The game is a basic 2D side scroller where the player must collect keys to proceed to the next level. The player will encounter different enemies and obstacles the will impede there way to the next level. The hidden mechanic of the game is the players heal; the player must manage the amount of health they have which in turn affects the player jump height and movement speed. After all the levels are completed, the player must defeat a boss in order to claim victory.
